In this project, we created an online library management system. It’s a whole new experience in the 
library world: software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library. It provides 
several services for different users including students, librarians and publishers. A user can create a 
library account, include his personal and professional information, access his navigation history 
and be presented with some recommended books based on his favorites. Also, a student can 
borrow books online, he can search for his target using any information he has (name, type, author, 
version …etc.), if the book is available he can borrow it for as long as he want considering the cost 
is weekly incremental (we offer the first week for free for new users), all he has to do is enter the 
expected return date and our server calculates the estimated cost and display it for him; if the book 
is not available, he can put on a request for it, the librarian will get it and he will try and provide it; 
or our system can provide him with similar books to choose from. When the student returns the 
book, he must first get the verification from the librarian about the book integrity before he gets the 
bill. In addition, our system provides publishers the opportunity to upload new books and get paid 
according to their value which is determined first by the librarian; they can also review the status 
of their book and see how many viewers they reached. It’s the complete package for library 
management.
